      Królik - [kru.lik] - was built on love. We want to build for you something that will make you truly happy. A Królik isn't simple a mchine or a tool, but a part of your life; we hope a meaningful part. Our vehicles are designed to seamless fit into your existing lifestyle meaning you do not need to compromise on safetly, reliability, or cost-of-ownership in order to drive.
