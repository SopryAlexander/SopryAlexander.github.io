    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
      <li> When will Apollo be ready?</li>
      <p> Apollo will release in the summer of 2025</p>
      <br>
      <li> Will we be able to pre-order Apollo?</li>
      <p> No, we believe that the product should be ready before it is put on sale. Taking money before being able to offer anything into your hands feels disingenuous and we are not that kind of company. Our cars will be offered on a by-order basis meaning that we  sacrefice speed for quality, accuracy, and customizability.

      <li> How customizable is Apollo? </li>
      <p> Incredibly so! Apollo is offered in a vast array of different body/interior colors along with multiple rim styles all made to order.
